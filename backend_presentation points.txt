Overview

Node.js + Express application for music analysis, using MongoDB for data storage.

This application allows users to upload audio files, analyze them with AI (SONOTELLER.AI API), and search for songs based on mood and themes. 

It uses Node.js for server-side logic and Express for handling HTTP requests, and MongoDB for storing data including large audio files via GridFS.

db.js -> manages the connection to MongoDB, ensuring secure and efficient database access.

index.js -> Sets up the server, handles file uploads, processes audio with external APIs, and provides search functionality. 


Introduction to Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server side, enabling asynchronous, event-driven programming. 

Express is a web framework built on Node.js, simplifying the creation of web servers and handling HTTP requests. 

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format, ideal for handling unstructured data, like audio metadata. (Using it because it was an ideal cloud based solution for storing data and collaborating for a team)

The application uses ES6 modules (import instead of require) for modern JavaScript compatibility, offering better tree-shaking and module management compared to CommonJS.


Detailed Explanation of db.js

dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file to process.env, allowing secure management of sensitive data like database credentials. This is crucial for separating configuration from code.

MongoClient and ServerApiVersion: Part of the MongoDB Node.js driver. MongoClient connects to the MongoDB server, while ServerApiVersion specifies the API version for compatibility.

dotenv.config(): loads environment variables, ensuring process.env contains values like MONGO_PASSWORD

when we have our uri connection string, we put as the first parameter in MongoClient object. The second parameter is a JSON object giving information about the serverApi. (initializes MongoClient with URI and options)

let db, declares the variable to store the database connection, initialized as undefined.

async function connectToDatabase() defines an asynchronous function. It checks if db is already defined, if yes, then it will be returned to avoid multiple connections, which is efficient for performance. 

Inside the try catch block, the code attempts to connect to MongoDB using client.connect(). (the client object we defined before (given by MongoDB, has a method called connect)
The admin database is then pinged to verify the connection. After it logs success, it sets db to soundclaude_db (this creates a db (soundclaude_db) if it doesn't exist).
If there is an error, it is caught and thrown to the user.

The connectToDatabase function is the exported, making it useful to the index.js file. 


Detailed explanation of index.js

express: creates web servers and handles HTTP requests, essential for the application's backend.

multer: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, used for file uploads.

path: Node.js module for file path operations, like joining directories.

cors: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing requests from different domains, crucial for web applications. 

fs: file system module for operations like creating directories and reading files.

axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests, used for uploading to Catbox.moe

FormData: Creates form data for HTTP requests, necessary for file uploads

fileURLToPath: Converts file URLs to paths

fetch: Modern HTTP client for requests, used for the Sonoteller API

GridFSBucket and ObjectId: For MongoDB, GridFSBucket handles large files, ObjectId and manages MongoDB object IDs.

GoogleGenerativeAI: Initializes with the API key, enabling the functionality. 

with our genai variable (the GoogleGenerativeAI object) we use the getGenerativeModel method to select the embedding model.

express() creates an express application instance

with the express application, we use the use method with cors as the parameter. This applies cors middleware to all routes, allowing cross-origin requests.

then we use express.json() method, to parse JSON request bodies, enabling JSON data handling.

__filename and __dirname derive the current file's path using fileURLToPath, necessary for ES6 modules. 

uploadDir sets uploads directory path using path.join
